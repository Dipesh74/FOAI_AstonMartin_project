This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

A small Next.js + TypeScript project showcasing an Aston Martin sequence/experience.

Purpose
-------
This repository contains a Next.js app with a canvas-based scroll experience and an image sequence located under `public/images/aston-sequence/`.

Quick start
-----------
Prerequisites: Node.js 18+ and npm or pnpm.

1. Install dependencies

	npm install

2. Run the development server

	npm run dev

3. Build for production

	npm run build

Notes
-----
- The repo includes many image frames under `public/images/aston-sequence/`. These are large and can bloat the git history. Consider using Git LFS for those files if you plan to continue adding large media.
- Add environment-specific configuration to a `.env.local` file and don't commit secrets.

Contributing
------------
Small tweaks or documentation improvements are welcome. Open an issue or a PR with a short description of the change.
